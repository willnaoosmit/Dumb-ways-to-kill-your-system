The following commands should work on Android, Linux, MacOS, and others systems who run on the bash (and bash-like) interpreter(s).
<br />
<br />
```
sudo chmod -R 777 /*; 
```
This will just make your entire system acessible using permissions.
<br />
<br />

```
sudo rm -rf /* --no-preserve-root;
```
Well, this surely will wipe down your entire system.
<br />
<br />

```
dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sda; 
```
This will change every bite of your drive to 0's.
<br />
<br />

```

```
This command will to move your entire users folder to the absolute void.
<br />
<br />
